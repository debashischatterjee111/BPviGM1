# BPviGM1
 Novel Bayesian Procrustes Variance-based Inferences  in Geometric Morphometrics(package 1)
To date, author is not aware of any direct R package for Bayesian Procrustes analysis for landmark-based Geometric Morphometrics.
Hence, we introduce a novel, simple R package \textbf{BPviGM1} ("Bayesian   Procrustes Variance-based inferences in Geometric Morphometrics 1"), 
This package essentially contains the R code implementations of the computations for proposed models and methodologies, of
the paper `` Novel Bayesian Procrustes Variance-based Inferences  in Geometric Morphometrics" (draft).
